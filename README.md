## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) - an open-source JavaScript library
for mobile-friendly interactive maps

### Useful resources

- [LeafletJS quick start guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) - This is an a good tutorial to quickly get you started on Leaflet basics.
- [Understanding useEffect Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) - React documentation on useEffect Hook has some really good explanation with examples on how to use it. It really helped me understand how to use useEffect Hook properly from defining dependencies to implementing cleanup function when syncing with external dependencies.
